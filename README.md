Orchestrator + 2 workers. 4 tools.
Using [granite4:tiny-h by IBM](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-40-language-models).
Success rate 59%; dragged down by longer tasks.    

WIP: Replacing the orchestrator + workers architecture with a single agent with MCP to benchmark traiditional MCP vs tool search + code mode MCP.
